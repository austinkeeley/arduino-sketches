arduino-sketches
================

A place to store my Arduino sketches.  Most of these are modified versions of projects from
the book _Arduino Workshop_ by John Boxall, published by No Starch Press.  

### blink
The Hello World of Arduino.  Blinks the LED on the Arduino.

### LED Wave
LEDs lighting up in a sequence.  This one is the first to require resistors and a breadboard and to actually wire something together.
